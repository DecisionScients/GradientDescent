abstract = {Good-Turing adjustments of word frequencies are an important tool in natural language modeling. In particular, for any sample of words, there is a set of words not occuring in that sample. The total probability mass of the words not in the sample is the so-called missing mass. Good showed that the fraction of the sample consisting of words that occur only once in the sample is a nearly unbiased estimate of the missing mass. Here, we give a high-probability confidence interval for the actual missing mass. More generally, for k 0, we give a confidence interval for the true probability mass of the set of words occuring k times in the sample.},

abstract = {Many machine learning problems, such as K-means, are non-convex optimization problems. Usually they are solved by performing several local searches with ran-dom initializations. How many searches should be done? Typically a fixed num-ber is performed, but how do we know it was enough? We present a new stopping rule with non-asymptotic frequentist guarantees, which, to our knowledge, no ex-isting rule has. By comparing all stopping rules on various benchmarks, we shed light on their effectiveness in machine-learning problems, including K-means and maximum marginal likelihood parameter selection.},

abstract = {Heuristic search procedures aimed at finding globally optimal solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems usually require some type of diversification to overcome local optimality. One way to achieve diversification is to restart the procedure from a new solution once a region has been explored, which constitutes a multi-start procedure. In this chapter we describe the best known multi-start methods for solving optimization problems. We also describe their connections with other metaheuristic methodologies. We propose classifying these methods in terms of their use of randomization, memory and degree of rebuild. We also present a computational comparison of these methods on solving the Maximum Diversity Problem to illustrate the efficiency of the multi-start methodology in terms of solution quality and diversification power.},

abstract = {The standard method in optimization problems consists in a random search of the global minimum: a neuron network relaxes in the nearest local minimum from some randomly chosen initial configuration. This procedure is to be repeated many times in order to find as deep energy minimum as possible. However the question about the reasonable number of such random starts and if the result of the search can be treated as successful remains always open. In this paper by analyzing the generalized Hopfield model we obtain expressions, which yield the relationship between the depth of a local minimum and the size of the basin of attraction. Based on this, we present the probability of finding a local minimum as a function of the depth of the minimum. Such a relation can be used in optimization applications: it allows one, basing on a series of already found minima, to estimate the probability of finding a deeper minimum, and decide in favor of or against further running the program. The theory is in a good agreement with experimental results.},

abstract = {Validation can be used to detect when overrtting starts during supervised training of a neural network; training is then stopped before convergence to avoid the overrtting early stopping". The exact criterion used for validation-based early stopping, however, is usually chosen in an ad-hoc fashion or training is stopped interactively. This trick describes how to select a stopping criterion in a systematic fashion; it is a trick for either speeding learning procedures or improving generalization , whichever is more important in the particular situation. An empirical investigation on multi-layer perceptrons shows that there exists a tradeoo between training time and generalization: From the given mix of 1296 training runs using diierent 12 problems and 24 diierent network architectures I conclude slower stopping criteria allow for small improvements in generalization here: about 4 on average, but cost much more training time here: about factor 4 longer on average.},

abstract = {The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and its variants are algorithms of choice for many Deep Learning tasks. These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say {\$}32{\$}-{\$}512{\$} data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.},

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based continuous heart rate monitoring is essential in a number of domains, e.g., for healthcare or fitness applications. Recently, methods based on time-frequency spectra emerged to address the challenges of motion artefact compensation. However, existing approaches are highly parametrised and optimised for specific scenarios of small, public datasets. We address this fragmentation by contributing research into the robustness and generalisation capabilities of PPG-based heart rate estimation approaches. First, we introduce a novel large-scale dataset (called PPG-DaLiA), including a wide range of activities performed under close to real-life conditions. Second, we extend a state-of-the-art algorithm, significantly improving its performance on several datasets. Third, we introduce deep learning to this domain, and investigate various convolutional neural network architectures. Our end-to-end learning approach takes the time-frequency spectra of synchronised PPG- and accelerometer-signals as input, and provides the estimated heart rate as output. Finally, we compare the novel deep learning approach to classical methods, performing evaluation on four public datasets. We show that on large datasets the deep learning model significantly outperforms other methods: The mean absolute error could be reduced by 31 {\%} on the new dataset PPG-DaLiA, and by 21 {\%} on the dataset WESAD.},

abstract = {A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces. Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance.},

abstract = {We analyze stochastic gradient descent for optimizing non-convex functions. In many cases for non-convex functions the goal is to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that gradient updates are trapped in saddle points. In this paper we identify strict saddle property for non-convex problem that allows for efficient optimization. Using this property we show that stochastic gradient descent converges to a local minimum in a polynomial number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that gives global convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent on non-convex functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points. Our analysis can be applied to orthogonal tensor decomposition, which is widely used in learning a rich class of latent variable models. We propose a new optimization formulation for the tensor decomposition problem that has strict saddle property. As a result we get the first online algorithm for orthogonal tensor decomposition with global convergence guarantee.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * * , 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {A random sample is drawn from a population of animals of various species. (The theory may also be applied to studies of literary vocabulary, for example.) If a particular species is represented r times in the sample of size N, then r/N is not a good estimate of the population frequency, p, when r is small. Methods are given for estimating p, assuming virtually nothing about the underlying population. The estimates are expressed in terms of smoothed values of the numbers nr (r= 1, 2, 3, ...), where nr is the number of distinct species that are each represented r times in the sample. (nr may be described as â€˜the frequency of the frequency r'.) Turing is acknowledged for the most interesting formula in this part of the work. An estimate of the proportion of the population represented by the species occurring in the sample is an immediate corollary. Estimates are made of measures of heterogeneity of the population, including Yule's â€˜characteristic' and Shannon's â€˜entropy'. Methods are then discussed that do depend on assumptions about the underlying population. It is here that most work has been done by other writers. It is pointed out that a hypothesis can give a good fit to the numbers nr but can give quite the wrong value for Yule's characteristic. An example of this is Fisher's fit to some data of Williams's on Macrolepidoptera.},

abstract = {Schumacher, Vose {\&} Whitley [1] have shown that Wolpert {\&} MacReady's celebrated No Free Lunch theorem [2] applies only to classes of target functions which are closed under permutation (c.u.p.). In the same paper, Schumacher et al. demonstrated that there exist both highly compressible and highly incompressible classes of objective functions for which NFL applies. However, I will show that there is a free lunch for the class of all n-compressible target functions f : X â†’ Y given reasonable conditions on n, |X | and |Y|. While previous authors [3, 4] have considered NFL in the context of some form of complexity restriction on function classes, this paper appears to be the first to contain a proof using the general measure of Kolmogorov complexity. 1. NO FREE LUNCH When evolutionary algorithms were first introduced, it was hoped that they might provide a general-purpose "black box" search/optimisation tool. However, in [2], Wolpert {\&} MacReady proved that the average performance of all search algorithms, considered over the class of all possible target functions, is the same. Consequently evolutionary computing methods are "no better" than random search when considered over all possible fitness functions. It was subsequently proved in [1] that this "No Free Lunch" (NFL) result extends to classes of function other than the uniform class. NFL holds in the average case, regardless of the algorithm performance measure used, if and only if the class of functions under consideration is closed under permutation (c.u.p.). The lack of structure of c.u.p. classes has information-theoretic implications which have been explored in [5, 6] using Shannon-Weaver information theory; this paper investigates that lack of structure from an algorithmic information theory perspective using Kolmogorov complexity. I conclude that if we consider the class of algorithmically non-random (i.e. compressible) target functions, NFL does not hold. of largely theoretical interest to researchers using artificial evolution. This is due to a number of practical considerations such as local correlation structure in fitness spaces [7] and NFL assumptions ignoring algorithmic complexity [8]. The result presented in this paper is similarly theoretical rather than practical; nevertheless, it extends previously published work. 2. ASSUMPTIONS As in most previous NFL work, it is assumed that the search domain X and the set of objective values Y are sets of finite cardinality. Because the terms will be used frequently, I will use X = |X | and Y = |Y| to denote the cardinality of X and Y respectively. To avoid the trivial case where NFL necessarily holds, I will assume that Y â‰¥ 2. Additionally, it will be assumed that X â‰« 1 and that X â‰¥ Y. This is justified by the fact that in most practical search tasks the set of possible values of a target function is represented as a single fixed-width integer or floating-point number whilst the set of possible solutions is far larger. It is also justified in any case where target values are only used to rank possible solutions relative to one another, because the number of possible ranks is no larger than the number of possible solutions. 3.

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

This article reviews different techniques that can be used for each of these three subtasks and discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of each technique with references to theoretical and empirical studies. Further, recommendations are given to encourage best practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. In the context of discussing the bias-variance trade-off, leave-one-out cross-validation is compared to k-fold cross-validation, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence.

abstract = {The area's standard text revised and expanded. During the past decade has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book descibes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression {\&} path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data ( p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit.},

Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function , which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regu-larization functions and domain constraints.

@article{Varma2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cross-validation (CV) is an effective method for estimating the prediction error of a classifier. Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the CV error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the CV error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data. RESULTS: We used CV to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random training datasets were created, with no difference in the distribution of the features between the two classes. Using these "null" datasets, we selected classifier parameter values that minimized the CV error estimate. 10-fold CV was used for Shrunken Centroids while Leave-One-Out-CV (LOOCV) was used for the SVM. Independent test data was created to estimate the true error. With "null" and "non null" (with differential expression between the classes) data, we also tested a nested CV procedure, where an inner CV loop is used to perform the tuning of the parameters while an outer CV is used to compute an estimate of the error. The CV error estimate for the classifier with the optimal parameters was found to be a substantially biased estimate of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data. Even though there is no real difference between the two classes for the "null" datasets, the CV error estimate for the Shrunken Centroid with the optimal parameters was less than 30{\{}{\%}{\}} on 18.5{\{}{\%}{\}} of simulated training data-sets. For SVM with optimal parameters the estimated error rate was less than 30{\{}{\%}{\}} on 38{\{}{\%}{\}} of "null" data-sets. Performance of the optimized classifiers on the independent test set was no better than chance. The nested CV procedure reduces the bias considerably and gives an estimate of the error that is very close to that obtained on the independent testing set for both Shrunken Centroids and SVM classifiers for "null" and "non-null" data distributions. CONCLUSION: We show that using CV to compute an error estimate for a classifier that has itself been tuned using CV gives a significantly biased estimate of the true error. Proper use of CV for estimating true error of a classifier developed using a well defined algorithm requires that all steps of the algorithm, including classifier parameter tuning, be repeated in each CV loop. A nested CV procedure provides an almost unbiased estimate of the true error.},

abstract = {Gradient descent is an extremely simple algorithm-simpler than most of the algorithms you studied in CS161-that has been around for centuries. These days, the main "killer app" is machine learning. Model-fitting often reduces to optimization-for example, maximizing the likelihood of observed data over a family of generative models. A remarkably large fraction of modern machine learning research, including some of the much-hyped recent work on "deep learning," boils down to implementing variants of gradient descent on a very large scale (i.e., for huge training sets). Indeed, the choice of models in many machine learning applications is driven as much by computational considerations-whether or not gradient descent can be implemented quickly-as by any other criteria. The first goal of these notes is to develop the geometry and intuition behind gradient descent, to the point that the algorithm seems totally obvious. The second goal is to make the general method concrete with a case study on linear regression. (The method is also very useful for many other problems.) Throughout these notes, you might want to keep Figure 1 in mind. The figures show a succession of lines that are an increasingly good fit for a collection of points in the plane. "Linear regression" just means computing the best-fitting line, and this succession of lines is generated by successive iterations of gradient descent. This is not all supposed to make 100{\%} sense yet, of course-the rest of the notes explains what's going on-but this example should provide you with a concrete picture to refer back to as the lecture proceeds. *},

abstract = {Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma has a poor prognosis because of the high intrahepatic recurrence rate. There are technological limitations to traditional methods such as TNM staging for accurate prediction of recurrence, suggesting that new techniques are needed. Methods: We investigated mRNA expression profiles in tissue specimens from a training set, comprising 33 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays representing about 6000 genes. We used this training set in a supervised learning manner to construct a predictive system, consisting of 12 genes, with the Fisher linear classifier. We then compared the predictive performance of our system with that of a predictive system with a support vector machine (SVM-based system) on a blinded set of samples from 27 newly enrolled patients. Findings: Early intrahepatic recurrence within 1 year after curative surgery occurred in 12 (36{\%}) and eight (30{\%}) patients in the training and blinded sets, respectively. Our system correctly predicted early intrahepatic recurrence or non-recurrence in 25 (93{\%}) of 27 samples in the blinded set and had a positive predictive value of 88{\%} and a negative predictive value of 95{\%}. By contrast, the SVM-based system predicted early intrahepatic recurrence or non-recurrence correctly in only 16 (60{\%}) individuals in the blinded set, and the result yielded a positive predictive value of only 38{\%} and a negative predictive value of 79{\%}. Interpretation: Our system predicted early intrahepatic recurrence or non-recurrence for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma much more accurately than the SVM-based system, suggesting that our system could serve as a new method for characterising the metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma.},
